# "Fishing" Project

ITE423 - Information Security: FINAL PROJECT

Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea

Spring 2023


## Description
Our simple, example webpage was built using the following: a GoDaddy domain, a bucket hosted on AWS S3, AWS Route 53, VS Code, an HTTP Request Inspector. The goal was to steal ID and password via a fake login system, while trying to mimic the legitimacy of the actual website. The website we decided to mimic is a popular online marketplace in South Korea. 

*(all files stored on AWS bucket)*
